# Balance: Your All-In-One Lifestyle App






**Balance** is a all-in-one lifestyle app that empowers users to set, track, and maintain both physical and mental health goals. Designed to encourage a balanced lifestyle, the app integrates seamlessly with HealthKit for physical metrics as well as CoreData for persistent data tracking and offers personalized goal-setting capabilities.
Balance is still in active development and is in what I would consider a beta build, with all core functionality, UI design, and features in place in this working build, however stay tuned and follow this repo for updates as I continue to implement new features, fixing potential bugs, and more!

## Overview

The Balance app is structured using **MVVC (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator)** architecture to maintain a clean, modular, and easily scalable codebase. This design choice enhances code reusability and separation of concerns, enabling clear boundaries between the user interface, data handling, and business logic. Additionally, the design flow, UI, animations (including screen-to-screen state flow diagrams, UI design choices, transition animations) were designed and prototyped in **Figma** (mockups, wireframes, prototypes)
 as well as **draw.io** for the app flow (see App Specification folder), which provided a quality guideline to follow before starting development in line with best practices for quality app development flow.
## Key Features

- **Goal Tracking**: Track both physical and mental wellness goals, such as workouts, meditation, and outdoor time.
- **Customizable Goals**: Go beyond pre-set options by creating custom goals, providing a personalized experience.
- **HealthKit Integration**: Syncs with HealthKit to automatically track physical health metrics like steps, calories, and workout duration.
- **Data Persistence with Core Data**: Stores user-selected goals and progress locally, allowing data to persist across app launches.
- **Engaging User Interface**: Custom-designed UI for an engaging and immersive experience, including personalized onboarding, goal progress views, and an interactive calendar for daily achievements.

## Implementation Details

### Architecture and Design

Balance is built with **MVVC architecture** to support a clean, modular code structure:

- **Model**: Core Data models and HealthKit integrations handle data storage and physical health metrics.
- **ViewModel**: The `CoreDataViewModel` class manages data retrieval, update operations, and HealthKit authorization and data fetching. It acts as the intermediary between the Model and Views, ensuring data binding and logic handling.
- **View**: SwiftUI views present the data to the user with dynamic elements that adjust based on user interaction and HealthKit data.
- **Coordinator (if applicable)**: Handles navigation and flow, managing transitions between different screens, especially during onboarding.

### Development Process

Balanceâ€™s design was meticulously planned using **wireframes and mockups** created in Figma, which are available in the "App Specification" folder in this GitHub repository. These designs serve as the blueprint for the app's structure, ensuring a consistent and user-centered approach to development.

- **Onboarding Flow**: Guides users through a personalized setup, allowing them to select physical, mental, and custom goals. Each onboarding screen is designed with transparency effects and individual goal tracking toggles.
- **Home and Progress Views**: The Home View serves as a dashboard for daily goals, while the Progress View provides a visual calendar representation of progress, using color-coded indicators for different goal categories.
- **Goal Tracking**: Utilizes HealthKit data to automatically update physical health metrics, with Core Data handling the local storage of progress.

## Technologies

- **SwiftUI**: Used for building the UI, with support for both portrait and landscape orientations.
- **Core Data**: Ensures data persistence for goal-tracking selections and user progress.
- **HealthKit**: Syncs and fetches data directly from the HealthKit API for physical activity metrics.
- **Figma**: Employed during the design phase to create mockups and wireframes, ensuring that development aligns closely with the intended user experience.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `Balance.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3. Run on iOS Simulator or a physical device with iOS 15+.
